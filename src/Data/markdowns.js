 const klimato = `Klimato offers a digital tool for restaurants to work with sustainability, by calculating,
communicating, calibrating and compensating the CO2 emissions from food.  Klimato's
web-calculator has integrated the LCA (life-cycle assessment) data for different food items
from RISE and made it very easy to visualise the net CO2e impact of different dishes. With
Klimato, you are able to:

 * **Calculate:** Create recipes based on ingredients, production method and country of origin
    to quickly retrieve the exact CO2e-impact of each dish.
 * **Communicate:** Demonstrate transparency, inspire and encourage the consumer to choose more
    climate-smart choices with climate-marked menus!
 * **Calibrate:** Set climate targets, reduce emissions and show your progress to customers
    and employees with monthly and yearly climate reports. We’ll help you along the way!
 * **Compensate:** We help you offset unavoidable emissions through investments in Gold
    Standard certified projects.

Our climate-labels allow communicating the "environmental-friendliness" of the dishes to the
customers, and many of our customers, such as Bastard Burgers, Favo, Sodexo or Clarion Hotel,
have therefore increased the sales of their vegetarian and vegan dishes!

const a2o=`
A₂O is our formula for great taste experiences combined with a sustainable production
process. We are exclusively working with new protein alternatives, and in this case,
the yellow pea is our main ingredient. The yellow pea is 100% natural, has no additives,
and is harvested in the plains of Småland. Further, it has been fermented to bind the
flavors in the best possible way. This is simply environmentally friendly food from
start to finish!

const kthFoodTech= `**We connect KTH students to the amazing and fast paced world of Foodtech. Foodtech aims to improve agriculture and food production, the supply chain, the distribution channels, consumption and waste by the help of technology!**

So, what is Foodtech? We like to think of it as the intersection of food and technology; the application and use of technology to improve agriculture and food production, the supply chain, the distribution channels and ultimately consumption. Basically, this covers everything from the innovation of new amazing food products like Oumph or Oatley iKaffe to urban farming, delivery solutions and Foodtech IoT solutions!

We have identified the following:

Knowing about Foodtech is still pretty hipster.
Foodtech companies have a huge demand for talented students to help them save the world.
Students want to have a more sustainable diet and are very curious about more plant-based alternatives.
Therefore, our mission is to:

Make Foodtech mainstream by educating the students of KTH how Foodtech could be the main driver to save the planet as well as show how exciting food technology is.
Inspire students to be part of this incredibly fast growing and vibrant industry and match their talents with awesome Foodtech companies.
Showcase how many different amazing plant-based food options we have today by letting the students get first-hand experience in order to make it easier to make greener food choices.
