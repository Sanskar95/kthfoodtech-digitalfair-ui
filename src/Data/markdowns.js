 const klimato = `Klimato offers a digital tool for restaurants to work with sustainability, by calculating,
communicating, calibrating and compensating the CO2 emissions from food.  Klimato's
web-calculator has integrated the LCA (life-cycle assessment) data for different food items
from RISE and made it very easy to visualise the net CO2e impact of different dishes. With
Klimato, you are able to:

 * **Calculate:** Create recipes based on ingredients, production method and country of origin
    to quickly retrieve the exact CO2e-impact of each dish.
 * **Communicate:** Demonstrate transparency, inspire and encourage the consumer to choose more
    climate-smart choices with climate-marked menus!
 * **Calibrate:** Set climate targets, reduce emissions and show your progress to customers
    and employees with monthly and yearly climate reports. We’ll help you along the way!
 * **Compensate:** We help you offset unavoidable emissions through investments in Gold
    Standard certified projects.

Our climate-labels allow communicating the "environmental-friendliness" of the dishes to the
customers, and many of our customers, such as Bastard Burgers, Favo, Sodexo or Clarion Hotel,
have therefore increased the sales of their vegetarian and vegan dishes!

const kthFoodTech= `**We connect KTH students to the amazing and fast paced world of Foodtech. Foodtech aims to improve agriculture and food production, the supply chain, the distribution channels, consumption and waste by the help of technology!**

So, what is Foodtech? We like to think of it as the intersection of food and technology; the application and use of technology to improve agriculture and food production, the supply chain, the distribution channels and ultimately consumption. Basically, this covers everything from the innovation of new amazing food products like Oumph or Oatley iKaffe to urban farming, delivery solutions and Foodtech IoT solutions!

We have identified the following:

Knowing about Foodtech is still pretty hipster.
Foodtech companies have a huge demand for talented students to help them save the world.
Students want to have a more sustainable diet and are very curious about more plant-based alternatives.
Therefore, our mission is to:

Make Foodtech mainstream by educating the students of KTH how Foodtech could be the main driver to save the planet as well as show how exciting food technology is.
Inspire students to be part of this incredibly fast growing and vibrant industry and match their talents with awesome Foodtech companies.
Showcase how many different amazing plant-based food options we have today by letting the students get first-hand experience in order to make it easier to make greener food choices.

const globalBugs=`## Crickets, a Solution to a Sustainable Earth!

With a relatively short history of operations, our company is already known as a key player
in the alternative protein business…

Managed by a team of professionals from Sweden and Thailand, we have constructed a process
factory and an R&D cricket farm based on vertical farming and other innovative solutions
that have given us the knowledge needed to scale up to our first EntoPark planned to be ready by 2020.

The EntoPark takes the cricket farming to new dimensions and takes Global Bugs a great
step further to become one of the largest scale lowest cost producer of alternative
protein from crickets.

const mosaMeat= `Mark Post unveiled the world's first slaughter-free hamburger at a packed conference in
London and the start of Mosa meats followed. Mosa meat was started with the aim to
commercialise lab grown meat. Their focus now is to find scientific breakthroughs that
lower the price of the product and enable an upscale of the production process.

The meat product starts as a sample from livestock which is then cultured. The sample
contains stem cells of muscles which creates new muscle cells in a live animal when a
muscle is injured. The cells are placed in a medium containing all components needed for
growth in a bioreactor. They proliferate and are then forced to differentiate into muscle
cells by removing growth factors. Myotubes, a primitive muscle fibre, are created by muscle
cells and these are then placed in a gel where muscles fibres can form. These muscle fibres
then grow into small strands of muscle tissue which can then be layered to create meat.

const stockeldDreamery=`We love cheese. We love yoghurt. Ice cream too, and so many other animal based products
that are fundamental to our culture and heritage. But using animals to produce these
goodies is extremely wasteful and destructive.

In early 2019, Sorosh Tavakoli and Anja Leissner, started Stockeld Dreamery to challenge the
status quo and re-invent the foods we love, starting with cheese.

The non-dairy cheese products are seeing lower adoption than other products in the
category indicating unimpressed consumers. We agree. The most popular vegan cheeses
are made of coconut oil and starch. These are cheap and accessible but with an unimpressive
experience. Then there’s the premium desert cheeses made from cashew nuts. These are
expensive and cover only a niche category. This highlights a big hole in the cheese
market (pun intended).

Instead of coconut or cashews,Stockeld Dreamery is making cheese out of legumes that are formed
into what is called a “stable matrix.” This will allow the cheese to slice, melt, and
taste like the real thing, and also have more protein than some other vegan options.

Initially Stockeld Dreamery will sell plant-based cheese to foodservice providers in Sweden in a
similar model to Impossible Foods or Oatly. Down the road the aim is to create their own
branded product line for retail.

const rscued= `0% of all fruits and vegetables produced are thrown away. That’s insane!

We will change that. Through our juices we make sure that all raw products that still have more
to give are taken care of. There’s nothing wrong with the fruit, usually it’s the opposite.
A trivial reason like a damaged fruit box can be the reason an entire box of perfectly fine fruits are thrown away.

In our hands the fruit and vegetables are turned into sustainable produced juices, smoothies, ice
cream and other tasty goods. It can be a bumpy orange, a banana with flaws or a lemon that looks
like it just ate a lemon itself. We control, sort and wash. Dents are cut of. The little we sort
away gets turned into nutritious soil so that new veggies can grow. That’s good!

To work with rescued fruits is a challenge - it requires a lot of hands from our staff that knows
and understands the craftsmanship behind a really tasty juice and it also requires that we let the
natural flow of fruits and vegetables control what we do. A good structure for taking care of fruit
waste is lacking thus making it impossible for us to work with only rescued fruits. When we lack raw
products we buy it from our friends in the business.

When there’s no more fruit and veggies being thrown away we’ve reached our goal. Until then we
promise that we will never stop fighting for a healthy and sustainable world.

sustainable restaurants in their vicinity. Through the app, users are able to find dining
options that align with their personal sustainability values whether it is just "vegan or

compromising their taste buds. Sustainable restaurants are able to market their achievements
and practices and receive recommendations on the best areas to improve to make the biggest
impact on their carbon footprint while attracting the most customers. The sustainability
criteria used in the platform include animal product usage (vegetarian, vegan, flexitarian),
food sourcing (meat from regenerative farms, produce grown using urban farming techniques,
locally sourced), green energy usage, water usage, plastic usage, waste practices and much more.
Thereby, creating a diverse platform for people to match their values and connect.

We are three female engineers from three continents, connected by our passion to make the food
sector sustainable. Over the years, we changed our lifestyles to become more climate neutral,
and food remained the major area that was untapped. The ambiguity around what is sustainability
in a restaurant, what green practices are they following, is vegan the only way to be sustainable
etc. were questions that bothered us individually. When we met during our masters degree, we
shared our struggles with each other and united to fix this.

We are yipin, a family business that has made its own tofu for as long as we can remember. When the move went from China to Sweden in 1998, great-grandmother's tofu recipe had an obvious place in her inside pocket. Then we did not know that it would develop into a small tofu factory. Today we still make our tofu according to family tradition - in the way we grew up with and love, and with new exciting flavors.
