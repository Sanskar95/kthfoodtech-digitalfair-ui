Mosa meat was started with the aim to\ncommercialise lab grown meat. Their focus now is to find scientific breakthroughs that\nlower the price of the product and enable an upscale of the production process.\n\nThe meat product starts as a sample from livestock which is then cultured. The sample\ncontains stem cells of muscles which creates new muscle cells in a live animal when a\nmuscle is injured. The cells are placed in a medium containing all components needed for\ngrowth in a bioreactor. They proliferate and are then forced to differentiate into muscle\ncells by removing growth factors. Myotubes, a primitive muscle fibre, are created by muscle\ncells and these are then placed in a gel where muscles fibres can form. These muscle fibres\nthen grow into small strands of muscle tissue which can then be layered to create meat.\n\nVisit our website https://www.mosameat.com/.",he="We love cheese. We love yoghurt. Ice cream too, and so many other animal based products\nthat are fundamental to our culture and heritage. But using animals to produce these\ngoodies is extremely wasteful and destructive.\n\nIn early 2019, Sorosh Tavakoli and Anja Leissner, started Stockeld Dreamery to challenge the\nstatus quo and re-invent the foods we love, starting with cheese.\n\nThe non-dairy cheese products are seeing lower adoption than other products in the\ncategory indicating unimpressed consumers. We agree. The most popular vegan cheeses\nare made of coconut oil and starch. These are cheap and accessible but with an unimpressive\nexperience. Then there\u2019s the premium desert cheeses made from cashew nuts. These are\nexpensive and cover only a niche category. This highlights a big hole in the cheese\nmarket (pun intended).\n\nInstead of coconut or cashews,Stockeld Dreamery is making cheese out of legumes that are formed\ninto what is called a \u201cstable matrix.\u201d This will allow the cheese to slice, melt, and\ntaste like the real thing, and also have more protein than some other vegan options.\n\nInitially Stockeld Dreamery will sell plant-based cheese to foodservice providers in Sweden in a\nsimilar model to Impossible Foods or Oatly.

ICA V\xe4xa will work with the sustainability initiatives that have the greatest impact in the shortest time and that provide the greatest positive change in the entire Swedish food system.\n\nICA V\xe4xa will be a large and important part of ICA's new climate ambition of halving the climate footprint from customers' purchases of food by 2030",Ae="Johannas Stadsodlingar is based in Vallentuna. We took over a disused dairy farm three years ago where we now grow salads and herbs and other exciting vegetables \u2013 like pak choi and mustard leaves \u2013 in a circular system called aquaponics. We keep rainbow trout in large tanks; the fish waste is turned into nutrients for the leafy greens that float on rafts in water in separate basins.\n\nOur seedlings are raised in a separate room (where the calves used to be in the old dairy farm!). They grow in coco fibre until they are strong enough to be transplanted to the rafts.\n\nThe farm is run by Anke Johanna, her partner Thomas and colleagues Mikael, Tomas and William who together designed and built the aquaponics installation.\n\nClick here for more info\uff1ahttps://www.johannas.org/\n\n";function Oe(e){for(var t=[],a=0;a<e.length;a++){var n={},o=e[a];n.question=o.question,n.questionType="text",n.answers=o.options.split(","),n.correctAnswer=(o.options.split(",").indexOf(o.correctAnswer)+1).toString(),n.messageForCorrectAnswer="Correct answer.
